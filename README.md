Project-Daily
=============

My goal is to write at least one program a day to enhance my experience with coding and problem solving.

Programs may be test programs to benefit other projects, or practice/learn some programming languages. Chances are I'll be writing different things just to see if they work, and they aren't necessarily efficient. 

Some tests may end up looking very messy. Sorry!
