Project-Mini
=============

My goal is to work on at least one program a day to enhance my experience with coding and problem solving.

Programs may be test programs to benefit other projects, or practice/learn some programming languages. Chances are I'll be writing different things just to see if they work, and they aren't necessarily efficient. 

This is to encourage me to keep learning and polishing my skills in programming. If I haven't had time to do a legitamate test, I will default to learning a new language. I hope to keep pushing my abilities in each langauge and become skilled in them, instead of having dabbled in many languages and being unskilled.

Some tests may end up looking very messy. Sorry!
